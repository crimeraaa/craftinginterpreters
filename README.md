# What is this?

This repo is my journey working through [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/statements-and-state.html) by [Bob Nystrom (munificent)](https://github.com/munificent).

This is also my first time writing Java in literal years, and I don't really like the language :) I'm genuinely excited to start the parts in C though!
